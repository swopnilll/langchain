# Link Chain Overview

## Introduction

**Link Chain** is an open-source framework that simplifies the process of building applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It offers tools and abstractions that help developers create complex LLM-based applications without needing deep knowledge of machine learning or model training. Link Chain is widely adopted in the industry, especially by developers who prefer to use models as black boxes.

## Features and Benefits

- **Open Source**: The code is available on GitHub, allowing contributions and visibility into its workings.
- **Community**: A thriving community of contributors and creators building innovative applications.
- **Flexibility**: Enables easy switching between different LLMs, avoiding vendor lock-in.
- **Tool Integration**: Simplifies connecting LLMs with various data sources and tools.

## Key Functionalities

### Model Interaction
Link Chain abstracts the interaction with LLMs, providing a uniform interface for various models. This allows developers to switch models effortlessly.

### Prompt Management
- **Templates**: Create prompt templates that dynamically inject user input.
- **Optimization**: Manage and optimize prompts for better performance.
- **Serialization**: Convert prompts into a format suitable for LLMs.

### Document Loaders
- **Data Sources**: Load data from different sources (e.g., Notion, PDFs, emails) into a unified format.
- **Processing**: Streamline data processing before sending it to an LLM.

### Agent Support
Link Chain supports building agentic applications, enhancing LLMs with tools for:
- **Internet Search**: Enabling LLMs to search online.
- **Database Queries**: Allowing LLMs to query databases.
- **Email Sending**: Facilitating email communication via LLMs.
