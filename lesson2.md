# PDF Summarization and Query System Using LangChain

## Overview

This document outlines the process of building an application that processes PDF files, generates summaries, and responds to user queries using LangChain. LangChain simplifies the development process by providing tools to automate each step.

## Steps and Components

### 1. PDF Upload and Text Extraction

The first step is uploading a PDF file. LangChain provides an easy-to-use tool called `UnstructuredPDFLoader` to automatically extract text from a PDF. This process eliminates the need to manually parse PDFs, as the tool handles extracting the text content in a structured way.


### 2. Text Chunking
Once the text is extracted, it is divided into smaller, manageable chunks. The chunks typically consist of a set number of characters, such as 1000 characters, but this size can be adjusted based on the requirements. Chunking the text allows for more efficient processing, especially when dealing with large documents.

### 3. Embedding Creation
Next, the text chunks are converted into embeddings. An embedding is a numerical representation of the text that captures its meaning and essence. This step is essential for performing similarity searches and enabling the system to understand the content of the text on a deeper level. LangChain automates the creation of these embeddings, making the process easier.

### 4. Store Embeddings
The generated embeddings are stored in a specialized database called a vector store. These databases are designed to handle embeddings efficiently, allowing for quick retrieval and similarity searches. LangChain provides seamless integration with popular vector stores such as PGVector, Pinecone, and Redis, simplifying the task of storing and managing embeddings.

### 5. User Query Processing
Once the system has indexed the embeddings, it is ready to handle user queries. When a user submits a question, the system first converts the query into an embedding using the same method as the document chunks. This ensures that both the query and the document content are represented in the same format, enabling effective comparison.

### 6. Retrieve Relevant Text
After the query has been converted into an embedding, the system performs a similarity search within the vector store to identify the most relevant text chunk. The search finds the chunk that is closest in meaning to the query, which ensures that the system retrieves content that answers the user's question.

### 7. Send to ChatGPT
Once the relevant text is identified, it is sent to an AI model like ChatGPT, which processes the text and the user's query to generate a response. ChatGPT uses the content of the relevant chunk to answer the question, leveraging its understanding of the text to provide a coherent and accurate response.

### 8. Display Response
Finally, the response from ChatGPT is returned to the user. This response is typically an answer or summary based on the provided text and the user's query.

## Why LangChain?

LangChain provides several advantages that make the entire process of building a PDF summarization and query system easier:

- **Document Loading and Text Extraction**: LangChain includes tools like `UnstructuredPDFLoader` that automate the extraction of text from PDFs and other document types.
